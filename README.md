### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Games Programmer with a passion for low-level, engine and graphics programming using Vulkan & DirectX. I have experience using C, C++, C#, Unity, Unreal, and a variety of in-house game engines.

Graduated from the University of the West of England with a 1st class BSc (Hons) Games Technology degree!

I work at [Manifold Games](https://manifold.games/) as a high-performance C++ games programmer! 

I'm more active on GitLab, [check me out there instead](https://gitlab.com/users/WSWhitehouse/projects), or check out my [website and blog](https://williamwhitehouse.dev/)!
